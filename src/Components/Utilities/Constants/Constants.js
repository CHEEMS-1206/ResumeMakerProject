    "A resume (or “CV” outside of the US) is a formal document that provides an overview of your professional qualifications, including your relevant work experience, skills, education, and notable accomplishments. Usually paired with a cover letter, a resume helps you demonstrate your abilities and convince employers you’re qualified and hireable.",

A good cover letter grabs a Hiring Manager’s attention and gets you to the next step of the hiring process. Cover letters are not mandatory but can help in standing out from others when applying for jobs.",
